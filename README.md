# EMBEDDED-SYSTEMS-ROADMAP

# 1. Understand the Basics of Embedded Systems
     - What are Embedded Systems
     - Applications
# 2. Learn programming Fundamentals
     - Programming Languages C, then C++
     - Basic concepts (Iot Devices, Automotive systems,    Consumer electronics).
# 3. Get Hands-On Experience
    - Development Boards
        *Arduino (Great for Beginners)
        *Rapsberry Pi (More advanced Projects)
        *STM32 or ESP32 (For more complex applications)
    - Start Simple Projects like reading a button press or controlling a motor.
# 4. Study Embedded Systems Concepts
    - Microcontroller Architecture: CPU, memory, I/O ports
    - Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS): Understand the basics of RTOS if you're interested in more complex systems
# 5. Use Development Tools
    - IDE and Toolchains such as Arduino IDE for Arduino projects, PlatformIO for various platforms, STM32CubeIDE for STM32 microcontrollers
    - Debugging Tools like JTAG or SWD for troubleshooting.
# 6. explore Resources and Community
# 7. Build Projects
# 8. stay Updated.
